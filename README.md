# VirtuFader

VirtuFader is a MIDI to OSC bridge based around the PreSonus FaderPort 16 and it's high resolution motorized faders and scribble strips. VirtuFader allows you to configure an infinite number of virtual faders and is configured through a simple XML file. Virtual faders can then be scrolled using a rotoray encoder in a similar fashion to traditional banks. With over 16000 steps of resolution per physical fader, VirtuFader is designed to maximize input resolution to control any OSC or Midi compatible device or application with the smoothest precision possible. In essence, VirtuFader abstracts controlled paraters from phsyical inputs allowing an infinite number of parameters to be controlled from a single controller.
